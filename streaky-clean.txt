Privacy Policy

Last updated: 7 January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Streaky Clean (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use our Android application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR (EU) and Google Play Developer Program policies.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.

Any data you create while using the App is stored locally on your device only and never shared with us or third parties.

2. How We Use Your Information

We do not access, process, sell, rent, or share any personal data.

3. Data Storage and Security

All app data is stored locally on your device and remains under your control.
We do not transmit data over the internet or store data on external servers.

4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or crash reporting services.

5. Data Retention

We do not retain any personal data.
All data can be removed by uninstalling the App or clearing the App’s storage on your device.

6. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 18.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since no data is collected or transmitted, no child data is processed.

7. Your Rights (GDPR)

Because the App does not collect or process personal data, most GDPR rights (such as access, correction, or deletion requests) do not apply.

If you have questions about privacy or data protection, you may contact us at the email address below.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
